h1. Introduction

Towards a modular framework for interacting with external debuggers.

Debuggers we currently support are:

 * bashdb  (BASH)
 * gdb  
 * kshdb (Korn Shell)
 * pydb (Python)
 * pydbgr (Python)
 * rbdbgr (Ruby 1.9)
 * remake (GNU Make)
 * ruby-debug (Ruby)
 * zshdb (Zsh)

The debugger is run out of a comint process buffer, or you can use a
"track-mode" inside an existing shell.

h1. Installation

To install you'll need a couple of other emacs packages installed:
 * emacs-loc-changes (for storing marks at buffer locations)
 * emacs-test-unit (for unit testing)
 * emacs-load-relative (internal loading mechanism)

Get these from from http://githib/rocky as you did this package
